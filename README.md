# YourReps
A FOSS Workout Tracking Mobile Application

# Premise
The idea of this application is that generally workout applications are commericialized for customized workout plans and information
For users that are after a simple tracker to hold progress of their application, a simple local db is needed (which if managed correctly can be hotswapped for a live db)
Then users can track their workouts without cost.

# Community
Hopefully if the base project is written well enough, forks and community involvement can help to increase things like pictures for workouts, plan generation etc, however
the core offering should always be a tracker that manages a local saved instance of workout types and history.

# More to come
As the base project is written and things like coding style, design and ui philosophy etc are built out, we'll manage some general guidlines for contributors
